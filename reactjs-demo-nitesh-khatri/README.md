# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

when the user want to see the same student data it should show in atile view showing necesary fields only each tile will have a bun button for additional options such as edit, flag, delete etc
when a tile is clicked, show the entire details of the record in a beautiful view it can be an expanded tile or a modal style view etc we should be able to navigate back to the tile view from this expanded view any public api can be used to display the content on the grid / tile
